# IntelliMents
## Introduction
The project we want to introduce is IntelliMents and it offers a new way to learn how to invest through the core of our application: “Stories”, which are written, with the AI guidance, by investors for investors.

The application is designed to follow the Human Computer Interaction (active research field) and its guidelines on AI applications.

## Covered tasks
1. Learn something about the stock market
2. Create a story (write a story with AI guidance)

## Further developments
Since we wanted to focus on HCI principles, AI data are still hard-coded. 

In the feature, we will implement a model based on Natural Language Processing.
